This is a static web page created using HTML5 and CSS3 for the TechEden Hackathon conducted by DSC VIT-AP.

Outline:
Big Book Courses is an online tool to search for the right course of best price among famous learning platforms such as Coursera, Udemy, Unskool, Unacademy and many more. 

The problem this project solves:
The main objective of BBC is to make it easier for our users to find the best course available at the best price. There are various courses available throughout the internet and we have approached a phase wherein we do not know which is the best course offered. Our team has identified this problem and aims to compare the courses from different websites to provide our users with the best ones offered. It also has an e-Library which is completely free of cost. Anyone can download/ contribute to our library.
